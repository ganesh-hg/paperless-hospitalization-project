  <p>This department is manned with specialist in nutrition and dietetics. They are assigned to provide professional advice on diet for hospital inpatient wards as well as outpatient departments. Certain departments require that the patient be put on a diet and therefore the team works with many other departments that treat: Diabetes Cancer Kidney problems Paediatrics  Elderly care Surgery and critical care  Gastroenterology  These specialists can also suggest a dietary chart to be followed by the hospital canteen to ensure that all patients get nutritious food during their stay at the hospital.<br>Nutrition & Dietetics, a subdiscipline of Medicine, is the science that focuses on everything related to food and its effect on our health and overall wellbeing. Nutritionists and dietitians aim to improve people's health and help them make better dietary choices.<br> An authorized seal for the organization was adopted by the Executive Board and presented to members on October 24, 1940. At its center are symbols of the three main characteristics of the profession: a balance scale, representing science as the foundation and symbolizing equality; a caduceus, representing the close relationship between dietetics and medicine; and a cooking vessel, representing cookery and food preparation.Around the main design is a shaft of wheat, representing bread, the staff of life, and stylized acanthus leaves, representing growth and life.<br> Over the design is a cornucopia, representing an abundant food supply. Beneath the design is the motto, Quam Plurimis Prodesse. Around the edge is the name of the organization and the date of its founding written in Roman numerals.The seal is still in use on Registration Status Certificates for both registered dietitians and dietetic technicians, registered, as well as on the gold Member Pin.<br> According to current Academy president Sylvia Escott Stump, the group changed their name to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics in 2012 to reflect the scientific and academic expertise of its members</p>
