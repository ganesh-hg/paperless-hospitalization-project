  <p>Doctors in this department administer anaesthesia for patients for various procedures and surgeries. They provide the following services  Acute pain services post surgery  Chronic pain services for patients suffering from bone related illnesses like arthritis Critical care services for those suffering from trauma  Obstetrics anaesthesia and analgesia like epidurals during childbirth and anaesthesia for C-sections. Anesthetic, also spelled anaesthetic, any agent that produces a local or general loss of sensation, including pain. Anesthetics achieve this effect by acting on the brain or peripheral nervous system to suppress responses to sensory stimulation.<br> The unresponsive state thus induced is known as anesthesia. An anesthetic  is a drug used to induce anesthesia ⁠in other words, to result in a temporary loss of sensation or awareness. They may be divided into two broad classes general anesthetics, which result in a reversible loss of consciousness, and local anesthetics, which cause a reversible loss of sensation for a limited region of the body without necessarily affecting consciousness.<br>
A wide variety of drugs are used in modern anesthetic practice. Many are rarely used outside anesthesiology, but others are used commonly in various fields of healthcare. Combinations of anesthetics are sometimes used for their synergistic and additive therapeutic effects. Adverse effects, however, may also be increased. Anesthetics are distinct from analgesics, which block only sensation of painful stimuli.<br> An anesthetic (American English) or anaesthetic (British English; see spelling differences) is a drug used to induce anesthesia ⁠— ⁠in other words, to result in a temporary loss of sensation or awareness. They may be divided into two broad classes: general anesthetics, which result in a reversible loss of consciousness, and local anesthetics, which cause a reversible loss of sensation for a limited region of the body without necessarily affecting consciousness.Local anesthetic agents prevent the transmission of nerve impulses without causing unconsciousness. They act by reversibly binding to fast sodium channels from within nerve fibers, thereby preventing sodium from entering the fibres, stabilising the cell membrane and preventing action potential propagation.</p>
