  <h1 style="font-size:50px">CARDIOLOGY</h1>
  <p>The department as the name suggests deals with problems of the human heart or circulation. It treats people on an inpatient and outpatient basis. Some of their procedures include: Electrocardiogram (ECG) and exercise tests to measure the heart function Ultrasound scan of the heart .Scans of the carotid artery in the neck to determine risks of stroke 24 hour blood pressure tests Insertion of pacemakers Coronary angiography to see if there are any blocks in the arteries  Medical diagnosis and treatment of congenital heart defects, coronary artery disease, heart failure, valvular heart disease and electrophysiology Cardiac surgery All cardiologists study the disorders of the heart, but the study of adult and child heart disorders are through different training pathways.<br>Therefore, an adult cardiologist is inadequately trained to take care of children, and pediatric cardiologists are not trained to take care of adult heart disease. The surgical aspects are not included in cardiology and are in the domain of cardiothoracic surgery. For example, coronary artery bypass surgery , cardiopulmonary bypass and valve replacement are surgical procedures performed by surgeons, not cardiologists.<br> However, the insertion of stents and pacemakers is performed by cardiologists. To be a cardiologist in the United States, a three-year residency in internal medicine is followed by a three-year fellowship in cardiology. It is possible to specialize further in a sub-specialty.Echocardiography has become routinely used in the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of patients with any suspected or known heart diseases.<br> It is one of the most widely used diagnostic tests in cardiology. It can provide a wealth of helpful information, including the size and shape of the heart, pumping capacity, and the location and extent of any tissue damage. An echocardiogram can also give physicians other estimates of heart function, such as a calculation of the cardiac output, ejection fraction, and diastolic function </p>
